  abstract = {This paper explores the feasibility of using open data and an open source toolbox for ensuring reproducibility in operational performance analysis of air navigation services. To date the access to operational data in support of research claims or observed performance benefits is limited. Though the majority of related data sets are established and curated by government authorities, open data access is still in its infancy. ICAO promotes a performance based approach. In that light there is stronger interest in performing regional and international benchmarking comparisons. To advance the state of the art it is important to establish common methods and tools. This paper reports on the conceptualization of the benchmarking process as a data analytical workflow and the supporting developments of an open-source data-analytical toolbox. This feasibility study demonstrates the use of the process and open data to provide a framework under which official results can be validated. The benefits of this approach have been demonstrated throughout the on-going regional benchmarking projects. The toolbox developed offers scope to expand the functionality and make operational ANS performance analyses accessible to a wider audience interested in applying harmonized global standards.},

  doi = {10.17605/OSF.IO/3D6XX},
  abstract = {In archaeology, we are accustomed to investing great effort into collecting data from fieldwork, museum collections, and other sources, followed by detailed description, rigorous analysis, and in many cases ending with publication of our findings in short, highly concentrated reports or journal articles. Very often, these publications are all that is visible of this lengthy process, and even then, most of our journal articles are only accessible to scholars at institutions paying subscription fees to the journal publishers. While this traditional model of the archaeological research process has long been effective at generating new knowledge about our past, it is increasingly at odds with current norms of practice in other sciences. Often described as `open science', these new norms include data stewardship instead of data ownership, transparency in the analysis process instead of secrecy, and public involvement instead of exclusion. While the concept of open science is not new in archaeology (e.g., see Lake 2012 and other papers in that volume), a less transparent model often prevails, unfortunately. We believe that there is much to be gained, both for individual researchers and for the discipline, from broader application of open science practices. In this article, we very briefly describe these practices and their benefits to researchers. We introduce the Society of American Archaeology's Open Science Interest Group (OSIG) as a community to help archaeologists engage in and benefit from open science practices, and describe how it will facilitate the adoption of open science in archaeology.

  abstract = {Air Navigation Service1 (ANS) performance review needs to be based on an open set of flown flight trajectories and computed according to published, accepted standards and methodology. This paper describes the set-up of such a trajectory repository for the European region, the associated cloud based trajectory processing infrastructure and trajectory production algorithms. It also demonstrates the application for an initial use case within the terminal area. With a view to enhance transparency of performance results and to increase the level of reproducibility, we have developed a system to combine different data sources in order to produce a freely available set of flown flight trajectories for the assessment of European ANS performance. The capability is demonstrated on the basis of a use case analysis of holding patterns at a major European airport. Stakeholders are capable of reproducing the results by inspecting the underlying data processing and sample data. The presented cloud based infrastructure and processing setup form the nucleus of a reproducible and open data based approach to ANS performance in Europe. Both will be iteratively further developed to achieve the overarching goal of reproducible ANS Performance Review in Europe.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility\textemdash{}the ability to recompute results\textemdash{}and replicability\textemdash{}the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result\textemdash{}are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research. Consistent findings from independent investigators are the primary means by which scientific evidence accumulates for or against a hypothesis. Yet, of late, there has been a crisis of confidence among researchers worried about the rate at which studies are either reproducible or replicable. To maintain the integrity of science research and the public's trust in science, the scientific community must ensure reproducibility and replicability by engaging in a more preventative approach that greatly expands data analysis education and routinely uses software tools.We define reproducibility as the ability to recompute data analytic results given an observed dataset and knowledge of the data analysis pipeline. The replicability of a study is the chance that an independent experiment targeting the same scientific question will produce a consistent result (1). Concerns among scientists about both have gained significant traction recently due in part to a statistical argument that suggested most published scientific results may be false positives (2). At the same time, there have been some very public failings of reproducibility across a range of disciplines from cancer genomics (3) to economics (4), and the data for many publications have not been made publicly available, raising doubts about the quality of data analyses. Popular press articles have raised questions about the reproducibility of all scientific research \ldots{} $\carriagereturn$1To whom correspondence should be addressed. Email: jtleek\{at\}jhu.edu.},
